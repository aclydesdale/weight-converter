# Weight Conversion Tool


## Overview
This is a very plain and simple weight converter built with vanilla JS and Bootstrap 4. My goal was to make a simple and clean looking app that would perform the basic functionality.

## What I Learned
* Some extra use of classes within Bootstrap 4.
* Refreshed on some basic JS.
* Scope-creep is a real issue for myself (I forcefully made this project to be as simple as possible).
